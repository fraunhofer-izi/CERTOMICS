# LivingDrugOmics

LivingDrugOmics is an optimized single cell RNA sequencing omics pipeline for the purpose of high-resolution CAR T cell profiling. It supports the analysis of scRNA-seq data from common 10x Genomics single cell protocols, including gene expression, V(D)J repertoire and antibody/antigen recognition. Specific quality control metrics are incorporated for robust identification of CAR-positive cells.
