# CERTOMICS

CERTOMICS is a Nextflow-based pipeline tailored for single-cell multiomics profiling of adoptive cellular immunotherapies, offering enhanced certainty in immunophenotyping and data interpretation. The pipeline standardises processing 10x Genomics single-cell multiomics data and integrates CAR-specific identification and quality control. Additionally, a curated repository of CAR construct sequences and annotation data is provided, serving as a resource to support the analysis and development of CAR T cell therapies.
